# 5e-Turn-Manager-Tool
a tool for beginners to D&amp;D 5th edition to help them navigate their turn options during combat

This is my first program ever, and first python program. It just takes inputs and tells users what they can do during their turns.
There are a few options, action, bonus action, and movement, and they are removes as they are used per turn.
You can end your turn to reset your turn settings.
It's not perfect. There's still a way to crash it if you enter a string where it wants an integer.
There is no end command so you have to close the program to end it.
I don't know how to require integer inputs yet either.

Feel free to optimize for yourselves.

I still have a lot to learn and will update this project as I continue learning python. 
So hopefully the above issues will be fixed in the future.
